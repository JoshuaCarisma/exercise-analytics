## Personalized and Safe Exercise Recommendation System

**Objective:** Integrate exercise data with FMS assessment results to create a personalized and safe exercise recommendation system.

**Steps:**

1. **Data Integration:** Combine exercise attributes with FMS suitability ratings (green/yellow/red).
2. **Data Preprocessing:** Encode, normalize, and handle missing values in the dataset.
3. **Clustering:** Group exercises using K-Means or Hierarchical Clustering to identify suitable exercise categories.
4. **Classification:** Train models (e.g., Random Forest, SVM) to recommend exercises based on user-specific FMS results.
5. **Association Rule Mining:** Identify effective exercise combinations using the Apriori Algorithm or FP-Growth.
6. **Regression Analysis:** Predict performance outcomes considering FMS ratings to ensure safety.
7. **User Interface:** Develop a web/mobile app for users to input assessments and receive personalized exercise recommendations.

**Benefits:**
- Tailored workouts ensuring safety and effectiveness.
- Reduced injury risk by avoiding unsuitable exercises.
- Enhanced performance through personalized recommendations.
- Data-driven insights for program design.
- Increased user engagement with actionable, personalized insights.
